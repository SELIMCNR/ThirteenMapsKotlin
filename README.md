             Once you have your API key (it starts with "AIza"), define a new property in your
             project's local.properties file (e.g. MAPS_API_KEY=Aiza...), and replace the
             "YOUR_API_KEY" string in this file with "${MAPS_API_KEY}".
        -->


        The received API key is added to the Android manifest as follows: <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
            android:value="" />
